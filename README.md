Predicting red wine quality involves analyzing various factors that contribute to its overall character and taste. Factors such as grape variety, alcohol content, acidity, and residual sugar play crucial roles in determining the quality of red wine. Machine learning models can be trained on historical data to recognize patterns and correlations between these factors and the perceived quality . By inputting these features into a predictive model, it can generate insights into the potential quality of a red wine.
